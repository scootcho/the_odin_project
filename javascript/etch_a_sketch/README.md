Javascript project via The Odin Project [source] (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquery)

 * Create a page that generates grid of square divs using Javascript/jQuery.

 * Set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

 * Try variations of the sketching effects such as black & white and gradient steps.

 * Create buttons that enable resetting the canvas and using different sketching variations.
